    Near the southern part of Africa lies Paradise Island, which has a matriarchal society and only a few men; men are allowed to marry—but are executed two months later.  Lately, they don’t want to marry, and so the search is on for new men.
	A ferry plane with four men has to bail out near the island, and soon find themselves serenaded by a bevy of young ladies.  One of these tells Peter the commander that Paradise Island is ruled by the law of the beehive: the queen rules, and men are drones.  Nevertheless, males are needed, so the new arrivals feel welcome.  Peter notices there are no men around though, and becomes wary.
	At the occasion of the big rugby game, Arthur somehow becomes a referee, and makes a spectacle of himself.  Afterward, islander Rouana tricks himself into sharing her wine, which means they are betrothed.  Peter and the girl Jani hide Arthur by putting him in drag as a servant, but this doesn’t fool Rouana for long.  A skittish Arthur deserts her on the wedding night, so he will be compelled to take the leap from Widow’s Rock into the sea.  Instead, he learns that the crew’s radio has been fixed, and rescue is on the way.

  Arthur Askey is keen to please his audience, and he tries hard, succeeding most of the time.  The patter comes fast, and is laced with British-isms.  Will he be bored on the island?  Oh no.  “Just give me a glass of milk and a crossword puzzle and I wouldn’t call the queen me uncle.”  Ronald is also a spry, dippy comedian, but of a different sort, distractable, nerdy and over-enunciating, without the quick-firing buckshot gags and slapstick. He and Askey are a makeshift team, but it’s not abrasive for us to watch the two of them play off each other.  Good examples of their teamwork include the pair trying to read the map while girls keep popping up around them on the beach, and .  All the guys get a least a joke here and there.  Max to a passing woman:  “I could really go for you.”  “Alright, go!”  The women also know how to needle each other, for instance the line about a reticent bee being a “dumb girl turning a deaf ear to a blind date.”
	The island matriarchy is surprisingly well-delineated; we see the workings of the royal court, the guard, the scouts and the marketplace, and hear about customs and laws.  This is wartime entertainment for the English masses, so these are not threatening, warlike amazons, but mini-skirted flirts.  At first glance, and second glance too, it looks like a male ego’s re-rendering of paradise but, in some strange way, also like a valid way for a real society of women to organize, and for its citizens to behave.  If they want to wear makeup and shorts, well who’s to stop them?  They have effectively put men in their place, and I can’t say it’s not the most logical place.
	For entertainment purposes as well, there has to be a song every few minutes, but somehow this fits in with the zany atmosphere.  You wonder why the chanteuse keeps singing, “never leave me…” when she knows marriages are two months long.
